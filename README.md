# TimeAcademy
Odyssey Momentum 2020 repository for Time Academy

# We've created...
- Our React frontend, this is a wireframe mostly
-- To run you req. NodeJS
-- git clone this repo
-- cd TimeAcademy/web_app
-- npm install
-- npm start

- A simulator ( Kia.html ) to demonstrate how we intend the Kia token system to work.
-- Our simulator isn't working completely perfectly, we intend that you spend 100% of -ve and +ve tokens and not have balances while spending the opposing form of Kia :) 

-- To run the simulator:
--- Open Kia.html in any browser and it should work.
--- ( Potential issues: One of our Dev's is running the Gun.js Server and tunneling via NGROK :) however it should be available until 10pm CET )
